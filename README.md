Welcome to a project that I'm using to get a feel for test-driven development and mess around in general.

## To-Do
1. Design Game
2. Implement items
	3. Drop items.
	1. Have other mobs wear and carry items.
	1. Show this when you look at them.
3. Allow for looking at other rooms
4. Add doors
5. Implement stats and/or skills
6. Implement combat
7. Finish to-do list

## Notes
* When using rake test, test_ownership in TestMap class in the test/item\_test.rb file
fails, despite the fact that running it directly results in it passing.
